            <p className="text-lg justify-center flex md:text-2xl">I’m Syeda Mehwish Zeeshan, a web developer with a passion for creating intuitive and efficient digital experiences. My skill set includes HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and Python fundamentals, and I’m currently advancing my expertise in Next.js. Before transitioning into web development, I worked as an elementary educationalist, where I honed my ability to communicate, problem-solve, and adapt to new challenges—qualities that now enhance my approach to development.

                I’m deeply committed to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies, always striving to improve my craft and deliver high-quality, impactful projects. Whether I’m working on a small feature or a full-scale application, I bring the same level of enthusiasm and attention to details. Let’s connect and bring your ideas to life!</p>
